6. **Experiment**: Feel free to experiment with the code examples and modify them to suit your needs. This is the best way to learn!

## Tutorials by Difficulty Level

### Beginner Level

1. **Area Tutorial**: Learn how to use predefined areas with MetPy.

2. **Declarative Tutorial**: MetPy's declarative syntax simplifies data exploration and analysis by streamlining plotting in Python, hiding complexity to make data investigation more accessible.
 
3.  **Unit Tutorial**: Learn how to work with units within Metpy!

### Intermediate Level

1. **Upper Air Soundings**: Upper air analysis is a staple of many synoptic and mesoscale analysis problems. In this tutorial we will gather weather balloon data, plot it, perform a series of thermodynamic calculations, and summarize the results.

2. **xarray with MetPy Tutorial**: This tutorial demonstrates how to work with xarray, a powerful Python package for labeled arrays and datasets. MetPy seamlessly integrates with xarray's data model, offering convenient methods and properties for coordinate, coordinate reference system, and unit operations. 
### Advanced Level
